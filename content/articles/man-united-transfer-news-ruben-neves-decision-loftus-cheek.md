# **Ruben Neves** is one of the top targets for Manchester United in the upcoming transfer window, and the club is expected to make a decision on the player's future soon. The Red Devils have been linked with the Wolverhampton Wanderers midfielder for several months, and it is believed that they are willing to pay a significant fee to bring him to Old Trafford.

## Tactical Breakdown
Manchester United's tactics under Erik ten Hag have been a subject of interest, with the team often switching between a 4-2-3-1 and a 4-3-3 formation. The addition of **Ruben Neves** would likely see the team opt for a 4-3-3 formation, with the Portuguese midfielder playing alongside Casemiro and Christian Eriksen. This would allow the team to control the tempo of the game and create more scoring opportunities.

The team's xG (expected goals) has been a concern, with Manchester United averaging around 1.5 xG per game. However, with the addition of **Ruben Neves**, the team would be able to create more scoring opportunities and increase their xG. The Portuguese midfielder is known for his exceptional passing range and vision, which would allow him to pick out passes that would create scoring opportunities for his teammates.

The team's pressing traps have also been a subject of interest, with Manchester United often using a high-pressing game to win the ball back quickly. The addition of **Ruben Neves** would allow the team to press higher up the pitch, which would make it difficult for the opposition to play out from the back.
