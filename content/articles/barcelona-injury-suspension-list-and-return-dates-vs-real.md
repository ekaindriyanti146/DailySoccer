### Deep Dive Analysis

Xavi Hernandez's Barcelona side has been hit by a series of injuries, with several key players set to miss the upcoming match against Real Oviedo. Ferran Torres, in particular, has been ruled out for the foreseeable future after suffering a serious ankle injury in the Champions League match against Bayern Munich. The Spanish winger is expected to be sidelined for several weeks, leaving Barcelona to rely on other options on the flanks.

Another player who has been affected by injury is Pedri, who has been struggling with a hamstring problem. The young midfielder has been out of action for several weeks and is still not ready to return to training. Xavi will be hoping that Pedri will be available for selection soon, as his absence has been deeply felt in midfield.

Gavi, on the other hand, has been dealing with a minor issue, but is expected to return to action in the coming days. The young Spanish midfielder has been an integral part of Barcelona's midfield this season and his absence has been felt. His return will be a welcome boost to Xavi's squad.

Andreas Christensen, Barcelona's Danish defender, has also been ruled out for the upcoming match against Real Oviedo. Christensen has been struggling with a hamstring injury and is expected to be sidelined for several weeks. His absence will be a significant blow to Barcelona's defense, which has been vulnerable at times this season.
