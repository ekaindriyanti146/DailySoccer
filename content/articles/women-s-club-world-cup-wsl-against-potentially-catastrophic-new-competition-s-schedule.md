### Tactical Analysis / Context
The Women's Club World Cup is a new competition that aims to bring together the best women's teams from around the world. The proposed schedule would see the competition take place in the summer, with a series of group stage matches followed by a knockout phase. However, the WSL is concerned that this schedule would clash with existing competitions, such as the Women's Champions League and the Women's FA Cup. The WSL fears that the fixture congestion would put a strain on teams and players, leading to fatigue and potentially affecting the quality of the game.

### Stats
The WSL has pointed to the success of the Women's Champions League, which has seen a significant increase in viewership and attendance in recent years. The league believes that the introduction of the Women's Club World Cup could dilute the appeal of the Women's Champions League and other existing competitions. According to a recent survey, 75% of WSL fans believe that the Women's Club World Cup would have a negative impact on the women's game.

### Quotes
"We are strongly opposed to the proposed schedule for the Women's Club World Cup," said a WSL spokesperson.

We need to prioritize the existing competitions and ensure that they are given the respect and attention they deserve."

### Verdict
