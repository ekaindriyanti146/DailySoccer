**Real Madrid** is on the brink of a crisis, and it's not just the fans who are worried. With a string of disappointing performances, the team's alarming form has raised concerns about their chances of winning the La Liga title. As they prepare to face **Villarreal** in their upcoming match, the pressure is mounting on **Carlo Ancelotti** and his team to turn things around.

Here are the key takeaways from **Real Madrid**'s current situation:
* The team has won only two of their last five matches, with three draws and one loss.
* **Karim Benzema**'s injury has left a significant gap in the team's attack, and **Ancelotti** is yet to find a suitable replacement.
* The team's defense has been leaky, with an average of 1.5 goals conceded per match in their last five games.

## Deep Dive: Tactical Analysis
**Real Madrid**'s problems start with their tactics. The team has been using a 4-3-3 formation, but it's not working as effectively as it did last season. The midfield trio of **Luka Modrić**, **Toni Kroos**, and **Eduardo Camavinga** has been struggling to control the tempo of the game, and the team's transitions from defense to attack have been slow. The opposition has been able to exploit this, pressing high and winning the ball back quickly. **Ancelotti** needs to rethink his tactics and find a way to get his team playing with more fluidity and purpose.

## The Numbers Game
The stats don't lie, and **Real Madrid**'s numbers are alarming. They have scored an average of 1.8 goals per match in their last five games, which is a significant drop from their average of 2.5 goals per match last season. The team's xG (expected goals) has also decreased, from 2.2 to 1.9, indicating that they are not creating as many scoring opportunities as they used to. Defensively, the team has been poor, conceding an average of 1.5 goals per match in their last five games. This is a significant increase from their average of 0.8 goals conceded per match last season.
