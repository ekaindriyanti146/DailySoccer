Real Madrid, one of the most successful and storied clubs in the world, is facing an alarming slump in form ahead of their upcoming La Liga game against Villarreal. The **Real Madrid** team, known for their dominance and consistency, has been struggling to find their footing in recent matches, leaving fans and pundits alike concerned about their chances of success in the league.

From a tactical perspective, Real Madrid's struggles can be attributed to a lack of cohesion and coordination among their players. The team's midfield, which has been a strength in the past, has been unable to control the tempo of the game, leading to a lack of scoring opportunities for their forwards. Additionally, the team's defense has been leaky, with opponents finding it easy to breach their backline and score goals.

Some key stats that highlight Real Madrid's struggles include:
* 3 losses in their last 5 games
* 10 goals conceded in their last 5 games
* Only 2 clean sheets in their last 10 games
* Average possession of 55% in their last 5 games, down from 60% in the same period last season
