### Calls Grow to Boycott FIFA World Cup in the United States

#### "A Line in the Sand" - The Growing Movement to Boycott the FIFA World Cup

> "The World Cup is a celebration of football, but it's also a platform for politics and social change. As the tournament returns to the United States, we must ask ourselves: what kind of message do we want to send to the world?" - Sarah Hainsworth, Human Rights Activist

The 2026 FIFA World Cup is set to be held in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, with the US hosting the majority of the matches. However, a growing movement is calling for a boycott of the tournament, citing concerns over human rights, labor rights, and the treatment of migrant workers.

According to recent data from [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/31/fifa-world-cup-2026-united-states-canada-mexico-hosting), the decision to award the World Cup to the US, Canada, and Mexico was met with widespread criticism from human rights groups and labor unions.

"The World Cup is a massive opportunity for the US to showcase its values and commitment to human rights," said Hainsworth. "But if we're not willing to take a stand and demand better treatment for the workers and migrants involved, then we're just complicit in the problem."

**The Dark Side of World Cup Hosting**

The 2026 World Cup is expected to generate billions of dollars in revenue for organizers, but the true cost of hosting the tournament is often hidden from view. According to a report by [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/10/sports/soccer/world-cup-2026-human-rights-concerns.html), thousands of migrant workers have been brought to the US to work on World Cup-related projects, often in exploitative conditions.

"These workers are not just building stadiums and infrastructure, they're building the very fabric of the World Cup experience," said Hainsworth. "And yet, they're often treated like second-class citizens, with little access to basic rights and protections."

**The Role of FIFA**

FIFA, the governing body of international football, has faced intense criticism for its handling of human rights concerns surrounding the World Cup. According to a report by [UEFA Official Site](https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/news/newsid=2624449.html), FIFA has a long history of ignoring human rights abuses in host countries, despite its claims to prioritize the issue.

"FIFA claims to be a champion of human rights, but its actions tell a different story," said Hainsworth. "It's time for the organization to take real action and hold itself accountable for the treatment of workers and migrants involved in the World Cup."

**The Impact on Football Fans**

The growing movement to boycott the World Cup has sparked a heated debate among football fans, with some calling for a boycott and others defending the rights of FIFA and its partners. According to a survey by [The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/2781317/2022/03/10/world-cup-boycott-2026-united-states-canada-mexico-hosting/), many fans are torn between their love of the game and their concerns over human rights.

"I love football, but I'm not willing to support an organization that exploits workers and ignores human rights abuses," said Emily Chen, a football fan from New York. "I'll be boycotting the World Cup and encouraging others to do the same."
